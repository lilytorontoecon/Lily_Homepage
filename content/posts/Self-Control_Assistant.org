I (and my coauthor) cooperate with a *national-scale financial company* in China that issues *uncollateralized micro-loans*.

In a *field experiment*, we design a *new financial product* that helps preventing delinquency.

The new financial product is issued over 8 cities across several provinces of China.

- As the treatment effect, our product reduces the delinquency rate by approximately 1/5.
- Over 70% of our over 1000 customers voluntarily adopt this new product rather than the original product as they are aware of their self-control issues.
- These adopters have a substantially higher delinquency rate than the average because of selection.
- The results and the theoretical framework we built up for this experiment offer a new way to manage the issue of *over-lending and the resulting mis-management of personal finance*.
