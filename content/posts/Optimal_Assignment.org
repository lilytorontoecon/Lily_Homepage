In this project, I (and my coauthors) study how peer effects work inside the classroom. We tackle a new *optimal assignment problem*: how the teacher (as a "social planner") should optimally assign students so that their positive social interactions are maximized? The social planner has the power to control the *spatial proximity* of students. However, we find that the *social proximity* also matters.

The optimal peer assignment depends on both the *academic peer effects* and *the distribution of students* in each particular class.

See the below for an Example Seating Plan in a typical Chinese classroom:

Students are packed in paired columns, so that each student has a fixed deskmate. If only academic achievement matters, the optimal matching is *positive assortative* (PAM). We find that *social proximity* can break down this PAM.
